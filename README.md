# DoggosSketch
C# web application for artists to sketch dogs daily

This application uses [DogAPI](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to grab pictures from
As this is a simple application, I decided not to use any special architecture patterns

This tool could be benefitial for beginner artists who need to sketch daily
